Fit your model using the data contained in “train.csv” </br></br>\n\n 2. Use “test.csv” to predict new values based on your model. You must return a dataframe named `compare_result`, that includes `customer_id` and `spend`. The `spend` column must be your predicted values.","metadata":{},"id":"44033abf-a603-479e-8663-9a96fefee5a2","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Use this cell to write your code for Task 4\nmodel2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth = 5, random_state=9)\nmodel2.fit(X_train, y_train)\npred_y2 = model2.predict(X_test)\nmse2 = MSE(y_test, pred_y2)\ntest_pred2 = model.predict(test_df_dummies)\ncompare_result2 = pd.DataFrame(test_pred2)\ncompare_result2['spend'] = compare_result2[0]\ncompare_result2 = compare_result2.drop(columns = 0)\ncompare_result2['customer_id'] = test_df['customer_id']\ncompare_result = compare_result2[['customer_id','spend']]\nrmse2 = np.sqrt(mse2)\nrmse2\ncompare_result\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nGB = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators = 200,max_depth = 4, random_state = 9)\nGB.fit(X_train, y_train)\nGB_pred = GB.predict(X_test)\nmse3 = MSE(y_test, GB_pred)\ntest_pred_3 = GB.predict(test_df_dummies)\ncompare_result2 = pd.DataFrame(test_pred2)\ncompare_result2['spend'] = compare_result2[0]\ncompare_result2 = compare_result2.drop(columns = 0)\ncompare_result2['customer_id'] = test_df['customer_id']\ncompare_result = compare_result2[['customer_id','spend']]\ncompare_result.dtypes","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":381,"lastExecutedAt":1744107849586,"lastExecutedByKernel":"be926d95-aa31-453d-8ce8-c70c24a8c070","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Use this cell to write your code for Task 4\nmodel2 = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth = 5, random_state=9)\nmodel2.fit(X_train, y_train)\npred_y2 = model2.predict(X_test)\nmse2 = MSE(y_test, pred_y2)\ntest_pred2 = model.predict(test_df_dummies)\ncompare_result2 = pd.DataFrame(test_pred2)\ncompare_result2['spend'] = compare_result2[0]\ncompare_result2 = compare_result2.drop(columns = 0)\ncompare_result2['customer_id'] = test_df['customer_id']\ncompare_result = compare_result2[['customer_id','spend']]\nrmse2 = np.sqrt(mse2)\nrmse2\ncompare_result\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nGB = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators = 200,max_depth = 4, random_state = 9)\nGB.fit(X_train, y_train)\nGB_pred = GB.predict(X_test)\nmse3 = MSE(y_test, GB_pred)\ntest_pred_3 = GB.predict(test_df_dummies)\ncompare_result2 = pd.DataFrame(test_pred2)\ncompare_result2['spend'] = compare_result2[0]\ncompare_result2 = compare_result2.drop(columns = 0)\ncompare_result2['customer_id'] = test_df['customer_id']\ncompare_result = compare_result2[['customer_id','spend']]\ncompare_result.dtypes","outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":550,"type":"dataFrame","tableState":{"customFilter":{"const":{"type":"boolean","valid":true,"value":true},"id":"830d65b7-411f-447a-88b7-78e3b4ec11a7","nodeType":"const"}}}}},"id":"731cfa01-2709-413a-ac19-611e73e37c75","cell_type":"code","execution_count":46,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"customer_id      int64\nspend          float64\ndtype: object"},"metadata":{"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v1+json":{"status":"error","error":"Maximum recursion level reached"},"application/com.datacamp.data-table.v2+json":{"status":"error","error":"Maximum recursion level reached"}},"execution_count":46}]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"name":"Welcome to DataCamp Workspaces.ipynb","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
